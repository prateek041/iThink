## Phase 3: AI Integration

### Objectives
- Integrate Azure OpenAI for real-time AI debate.
- Ensure secure handling of sensitive information.

### Detailed Plan

1. **Set Up Azure OpenAI API Configuration**
   - Obtain API keys and set up environment variables.
   - Configure API client for authentication and requests.

2. **Create Secure API Routes for AI Communication**
   - Next.js API Routes: Implement server-side routes to handle requests to Azure OpenAI.
   - Data Sanitization: Ensure all user inputs are sanitized before sending to the API.
   - Error Handling: Implement robust error handling for API requests.

3. **Implement Streaming Response Handling**
   - Real-time Communication: Use Server-Sent Events (SSE) or WebSockets for streaming.
   - Response Management: Handle AI responses and update the UI dynamically.

4. **Create Separate Prompts for Each AI Agent**
   - Prompt Design: Develop distinct prompts for "For" and "Against" AI agents.
   - Context Management: Maintain context throughout the debate.

5. **Privacy and Security Measures**
   - Data Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data in transit.
   - Access Control: Restrict access to API keys and sensitive endpoints.
   - Logging and Monitoring: Implement logging for debugging and monitoring without exposing sensitive data.

6. **Testing and Validation**
   - Mock Data Testing: Test API integration with mock data to ensure functionality.
   - UI Validation: Validate real-time response handling and UI updates.

This plan focuses on secure integration with Azure OpenAI, ensuring that sensitive information is protected. The next steps involve obtaining your approval to proceed with the implementation.

## Design Principles
- **Modernist Look**: Clean lines, minimalistic design, and edgy elements.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the app looks good on all devices.
- **Consistent Styling**: Use shadcn/ui components and Tailwind CSS for consistency.
- **User-Friendly**: Intuitive navigation and clear visual hierarchy.
- **Interactive Elements**: Subtle animations and hover effects for engagement.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure all features are accessible to all users.

This plan will be updated as we progress through each phase. Feel free to add any additional tasks or features as needed.
